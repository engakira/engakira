ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @engakira
I am a project engineer specializing in product development solutions and embedded solutions.
I worked with medical equipment solutions such as electrocardiographs, external and internal cardiac pacemakers and remote health management systems in 1990/2000.
Since 2000 I've developed automation systems and embedded solutions in microterminals for POS solutions.
